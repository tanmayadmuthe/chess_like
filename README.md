Overview
This project is a simple chess game implemented in JavaScript that allows two players to play locally on the same machine. Due to time constraints, the game currently supports local play only and does not include WebSocket functionality for online multiplayer.

Features

Move and Capture Pieces: Move pieces across the board and capture opponents' pieces.
Game State Management: Tracks the current player, selected character, and move history.
UI Elements: Displays the current player, selected character, move history, and game outcome.

#Due to time inconvinience, I was able to make it using only HTML, CSS and JS.
